# SDCC
StateDrivenCharacterController

# Idea
The idea was to make a state machine that would control the player's behaviour (like IDLE RUNNING JUMPING etc).
Although it works, it did turn out that it gets complicated really quick and the component driven approach seems much more reliable at this point.
Nevertheless it does work and there is some sense to it.

# How to
Your everyday obvious keycodes, you move with WASD, sprint with LShift and jump with Space.
Press space while running alone the wall to wallrun.
